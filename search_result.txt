# XZ Backdoor Research

## Overview
The XZ backdoor refers to a malicious backdoor introduced into the XZ Utils, a popular open-source compression utility for Linux/UNIX systems. The backdoor was discovered in February 2024 and is associated with the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) number CVE-2024-3094, receiving a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.

## Background
- **Discovery**: The backdoor was discovered by Andres Freund, a Microsoft employee and PostgreSQL developer, on March 29, 2024, while investigating performance issues in Debian Sid.
- **Perpetrator**: The backdoor was introduced by an account using the name "Jia Tan". It is suspected that this name, along with others associated with the campaign, are pseudonyms.
- **Timeline**: The campaign to insert the backdoor spanned approximately three years, from November 2021 to February 2024.

## Mechanism
- **Functionality**: The backdoor allows an attacker with a specific Ed448 private key to execute remote code on affected systems. It alters the behavior of OpenSSH's SSH server daemon, enabling unauthorized access.
- **Dormancy**: The malicious code remains dormant unless a specific third-party patch of the SSH server is used.
- **Injection Method**: The backdoor consists of multiple stages and uses the glibc IFUNC mechanism to replace an existing function in OpenSSH with a malicious version.

## Response
- **Remediation**: The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a security advisory recommending rolling back to previous uncompromised versions. Major Linux distributions reverted affected packages to older versions.
- **Broader Impact**: The incident raised discussions about the reliance on unpaid volunteers for critical software infrastructure and highlighted the potential for widespread impact had the backdoor gone undetected.
